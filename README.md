# WebCrawler

This software was developed while I was an Intern at Intellinet Systems Pvt. Ltd. [ https://www.intellinetsystem.com ].
It is based on Scrapy (a free and open-source web-crawling framework written in Python. Originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs or as a general-purpose web crawler. It is currently maintained by Scrapinghub Ltd., a web-scraping development and services company) and uses Customized Spiders/bots designed to fetch Contacts and other informations from their Exhibitors.
